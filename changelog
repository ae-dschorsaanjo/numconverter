v0.2 (8. may 2017)
-----------

- Added version numbering
- Bugfix: When the program called with "--help --gui" arguments, it tried to
  call a yet non-existent function
- Minor formatting errors are fixed
- Bug fixed, that caused too strict validation while you use GUI
  (it accepted only lower case letters)... now it is converting the upper case
  input to lower case which is not nice, but works fine
