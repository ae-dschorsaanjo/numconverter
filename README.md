# numconverter
It is a simple number base converter from [1;36] to [1;36] bases. The original purpose of it is that sometimes it is needed to convert numbers from X to Y base and that I haven't got a better idea about what to program.

It is written in Python, doesn't use any external modules, hence it should work on any OS if Python3 is installed. It is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Win10.
